This is the first application that I made using Ruby on Rails following CareerFoundry's web development course.


What I've used and learned from this application:

-HTML and CSS/SASS
-Bootstrap Frontend Framework
-Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX
-Ruby Programming Language
-Ruby on Rails MVC Framework
-User Authentication and Authorization
-Stripe Payment Processing
-Caching
-Git Version Control
-Configuring Heroku
